roweis-identities
=================

A strange, nerdy tribute to Sam Roweis (1972--2010).

Sam had a profound influence on my life when I was a young man and I miss him dearly.

A while back when I was still actively mourning Sam's death, I ended up reading his
[notes](http://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/notes.html) page for probably the 50th time. I found his
notes on matrix identities particularly useful; even since the introduction of documents
like the Matrix Cookbook, Sam's notes were particularly straightforward. His list of
matrix calculus identities was a great help on numerous occasions.

I noticed a spelling mistake. _Jacobian_ spelt _Jacobain_. And sometimes in the past
I have wanted to copy and paste the LaTeX source, but haven't had access to it.

In some bizarre flight of fancy one afternoon several years ago, I decided to
recreate the LaTeX source from the PDF file. I decided I might as well put the result
online.

This roughly recreates [this document](http://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/notes/matrixid.pdf) found,
at the time of writing, on Sam's NYU website. Re-hosting it here in source form serves
several purposes:

* It allows for its impact to proceed if and when NYU ceases to host his website,
* It allows for the document to grow, be corrected, and so on,
* It hopefully will make more people aware of this useful set of notes, and in that
  small way, honour Sam's memory.

I'd eventually like to get around to his Gaussian identities cheat sheet.
